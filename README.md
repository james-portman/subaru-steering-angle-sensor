Steering angle sensor V416 Tokai Rika Japan

On the underside of the PCB it has an eeprom
93LC66BI
93LC66B really then I for industrial temperature range

Working to fix fault code P1767 on an apparently working steering angle sensor

It seems like once a sensor has been spun too far one way (with the steering rack disconnected) it flags a permanent fault

Installing a new sensor fixes this, but I think it is just a software fault

Looking at the insides of the sensor, it is not easy to actually break these
